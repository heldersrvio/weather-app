An app that displays weather conditions from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a location inputted by the user. It was written with the ReactJS framework.

You can look for any major city using the search bar, or let the app display the data for your location. The background image changes dynamically, depending on the weather conditions for the place you selected and you can also choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
